# 📏🔍 Breadth-first Search

- Breadth-first search tells you if there’s a path from A to B

- If there’s a path, breadth-first search will find the shortest path.

- If you have a problem like “find the shortest X,” try modeling your
problem as a graph, and use breadth-first search to solve.

- You need to check people in the order they were added to the search
list, so the search list needs to be a queue. Otherwise, you won’t get
the shortest path.

- Once you check someone, make sure you don’t check them again.
Otherwise, you might end up in an infinite loop.

## 🔵 Graphs

A graps is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.

A graphs models a set o connections.

|Edge|Relationship|
|:---:|:---:|
|Vertex|Rhing|


- Types of graphs:

    - Direct Graph

        - Direct Graph has arrows and the head define the relationship

    - Undirected Graph

        - Undirected graphs don't have any arrows, relationship is granted one each other

## 📚 Stack X 🚶🚶🏽🚶🏿 Queues

- Stacks are LIFO (Last In, First Out)

- Queues are FIFO (First In, First Out)
